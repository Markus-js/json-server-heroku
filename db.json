In previous years, we’ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as <em>React Native</em> and <em>React Hooks</em>. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.</p><p>This was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.</p><p>All the talks are available to stream online.</p><p>Here’s a summary of what was shared on stage:</p>",

      "body": "<h1>With SvelteKit crossing the 80% complete mark, over 5000 stars on GitHub, and now having more usage than Sapper, there's never been a better time to try it out! Many in the community have, making for quite a large showcase this month...</h1><p>Also, don't miss out on Svelte Summit on November 20th - featuring speakers from around the world. Keep an eye out for a watch party in your area 👀</p><p>Now onto what's new!</p><h2>New in Svelte and SvelteKit</h2><ul><li><p>svelte.dev now runs on SvelteKit alongside sveltesociety.dev. svelte.dev is a relatively complicated site with live code editing, authentication, and a markdown-based blog - making it a great way for us to really test out SvelteKit</p></li><li><p>A new compiler option, <code>enableSourcemap</code>, provides more control over the compiler output for JS and CSS sourcemaps (<strong>3.44.0</strong>). With this new feature, SvelteKit and the Vite Svelte plugin can now properly handle environment variables in <code>.svelte</code> templates (See sveltejs/kit#720 and sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte#201)</p></li><li><p>The Svelte Language Tools now support reading the configuration of the VS Code CSS settings (#1219)</p></li><li><p><code>vite-plugin-svelte</code> added a new <code>experimental.prebundleSvelteLibraries</code> option that makes it much faster to load Svelte libraries with many components like icon libraries and UI frameworks. The option can be set in the root of <code>svelte.config.js</code>. Please test it out and give us feedback!</p></li><li><p>SvelteKit will only route endpoints on the client, unless marked as <code>rel=\"external\"</code> - reducing the size of the client JS and making it easier to refactor the router in the future (2656)</p></li><li><p>SvelteKit no longer supports Node 12 (2604)</p></li><li><p>SvelteKit was upgraded from Vite 2.6.0 to Vite 2.6.12 fixing an issue where Vite would corrupt the Svelte runtime (https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/4306). It also included two fixes from the SvelteKit team to avoid or make diagnosing Vite issues in SvelteKit templates easier (https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/5192 and https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/5193). Vite 2.7 is currently available in beta with additional fixes for SSR</p></li></ul><p>To see all updates to Svelte and SvelteKit, check out the Svelte and SvelteKit changelog, respectively.</p><hr><h2>Community Showcase</h2><p><strong>Apps &amp; Sites</strong></p><ul><li><p>Tangent is a clean and powerful notes app for Mac &amp; Windows</p></li><li><p>The Pudding is a digital publication that explains ideas debated in culture with visual essays - rebuilt in SvelteKit</p></li><li><p>Power Switcher is an interactive overview of the development of the power supply in Switzerland, as energy sources migrate to cleaner sources</p></li><li><p>Sublive is a new way of making music by connecting musicians all over the world with a low-latency and high-quality audio network</p></li><li><p>Vibify helps you find hidden playlists within your music using your Spotify listening history</p></li><li><p>Browse Marvel Unlimited by Year is a SvelteKit site to see what issues are available on Marvel Unlimited for a given year</p></li><li><p>Files, a modern file explorer for Windows, has a new site rebuilt with SvelteKit</p></li><li><p>lil-hash is a simple URL shortener that produces easily rememberable and speakable shortened URLs</p></li><li><p>PWA Haven is a collection of small, fast, simple PWAs to replace native OS apps</p></li><li><p>DottoBit is a multi-color 16-bit drawing program with URL sharing built-in</p></li><li><p>Former Fast Document for Print is an invoice generator with beautiful designs, abilities for international languages and auto calculation</p></li><li><p>Helvetikon is a community maintained dictionary for the Swiss German language</p></li><li><p>Palitra App is a search-based color pallete generator</p></li></ul><p><strong>Podcasts Featuring Svelte</strong></p><ul><li><p>Svelte Radio dives into the tech behind the recently released Svelte Summit website and a bunch of other fun stuff!</p></li><li><p>PodRocket, LogRocket's podcast, talks Svelte with Rich Harris</p></li><li><p>PodRocket also dove deep into Elder.js with Nick Reese</p></li><li><p>Web Rush and Rich Harris talk about the differences between a SPA and MPA, what role the server rendering plays, what client side hydration is, and the state of modern tooling for developing an SPA or MPA</p></li><li><p>devtools.fm talks with Rich Harris about developing engaging data visualizations and building the tools of tomorrow</p></li></ul><p><strong>Educational Content</strong></p><ul><li><p>Have Single-Page Apps Ruined the Web?

      "title": "Vue 2.6 released",
      "body": "<p>Yesterday we just celebrated the 5th Vueniversary — today we are excited to announce the release of Vue 2.6 “Macross”!</p><p>In the past year, we spent a lot of time working on the new CLI and prototyping for 3.0. As a result, Vue core 2.x hasn’t received major updates in quite a while. It’s about time! This release combines a number of substantial improvements, internal changes and new features which are highlighted in this post. For full details, make sure to also check out the full release note on GitHub.</p><h1><strong>Slots: New Syntax, Performance Improvements &amp; Alignment with 3.0</strong></h1><p>Slots is an important mechanism that enables flexible component composition in Vue. During the prototyping for 3.0 we discovered a number of ways to improve it. Some of these can be introduced without breaking changes, which allows us to ship them in a 2.x minor release. For those that do require breaking changes, we are also trying to provide progressive alternatives in 2.x that would make future migrations easier.</p><h2><strong>New Syntax</strong></h2><p>The first step is the new syntax of scoped slots. We proposed, discussed and experimented with a number of different designs (1, 2, 3) and eventually landed on the new <code>v-slot</code> syntax outlined in this RFC. Here is a brief example using named slots:</p>",

      "title": "Plans for the Next Iteration of Vue.js",
      "body": "<p>Last week at Vue.js London I gave a brief sneak peek of what’s coming in the next major version of Vue. This post provides an in-depth overview of the plan.</p><h1><strong>Why a new major version?</strong></h1><p>Vue 2.0 was released exactly two years ago (how time flies!). During this period, the core has remained backwards compatible with five minor releases. We’ve accumulated a number of ideas that would bring improvements, but they were held off because they would result in breaking changes. At the same time, the JavaScript ecosystem and the language itself has been evolving rapidly. There are greatly improved tools that could enhance our workflow, and many new language features that could unlock simpler, more complete, and more efficient solutions to the problems Vue is trying to solve. What’s more exciting is that we are seeing ES2015 support becoming a baseline for all major evergreen browsers. Vue 3.0 aims to leverage these new language features to make Vue core smaller, faster, and more powerful.</p><p>Vue 3.0 is currently in prototyping phase, and we have already implemented a runtime close to feature-parity with 2.x. <strong>Many of the items listed below are either already implemented, or confirmed to be feasible. Ones that are not yet implemented or still in exploration phase are marked with a *.</strong></p><h1><strong>The Details</strong></h1><h2><strong>High-Level API Changes</strong></h2><blockquote><p><em>TL;DR: Everything except render function API and scoped-slots syntax will either remain the same or can be made 2.x compatible via a compatibility build.</em></p></blockquote><p>Since it’s a new major, there is going to be some breaking changes. However, we take backwards compatibility seriously, so we want to start communicating these changes as soon as possible. Here’s the currently planned public API changes:</p><ul><li><p>Template syntax will remain 99% the same. There may be small tweaks in scoped slots syntax, but other than that we have no plans to change anything else for templates.</p></li><li><p>̶3̶.̶0̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶s̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶c̶l̶a̶s̶s̶-̶b̶a̶s̶e̶d̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶o̶n̶e̶n̶t̶s̶ ̶n̶a̶t̶i̶v̶e̶l̶y̶ . <em>Update: the Class API draft has been dropped. We have published a new function-based API proposal that provides better logic composition, better TypeScript support, and compatible with 2.x API.</em></p></li><li><p>Mixins will still be supported.*</p></li><li><p>Top level APIs will likely receive an overhaul to avoid globally mutating the Vue runtime when installing plugins. Instead, plugins will be applied and scoped to a component tree. This will make it easier to test components that rely on specific plugins, and also make it possible to mount multiple Vue applications on the same page with different plugins, but using the same Vue runtime.* <em>(Update: related RFC)</em></p></li><li><p>Functional components can finally be plain functions —however, async components will now need to be explicitly created via a helper function. <em>(Update: related RFC)</em></p></li><li><p>The part that will receive the most changes is the Virtual DOM format used in render functions. We are currently collecting feedback from major library authors and will be sharing more details as we are more confident of the changes, but as long as you don’t heavily rely on hand-written (non-JSX) render functions in your app, upgrading should be a reasonably straightforward process.</p></li></ul>",

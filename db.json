This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.</p><p>This was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.</p><p>All the talks are available to stream online.</p><p>Here’s a summary of what was shared on stage:</p>",

(20:00)</p></li><li><p>Steph Dietz explained how Svelte's simple abstractions makes it easy for beginners and experts alike to learn and use JavaScript - without the boilerplate (29:00)</p></li><li><p>Kevin Bridges dove deep into Svelte's reactivity logic by visualizing it through <code>ReflectiveCounter</code> and showing how to \"fine tune\" it, as needed. A full \"syllabus\" for the presentation is available on Kevin's site. (42:55)</p></li><li><p>Mateo Morris launched Primo, an all-in-one SvelteKit CMS to help build and manage static sites (1:12:34)</p></li><li><p>Guillermo Rauch explained Vercel's commitment to Svelte, what it means to have Rich on the team, and what's coming next from the company... (1:21:54)</p></li><li><p>Geoff Rich introduced various ways to modify motion and transitions within Svelte to be more accessible to all users of the web. Slides and a full transcription of the talk are available on Geoff's site. (1:32:30)</p></li><li><p>Dean Fogarty demoed a number of different use-cases for custom stores - transforming data to and from storage mechanisms within Svelte. Transcript and code is available on Dean's GitHub.

Their first event was on November 29th - all future events can be found on the Svelte Sirens website (3:50:45)</p></li><li><p>Rich Harris discussed creating libraries with SvelteKit, better ways to link packages when developing, and how SvelteKit helps with modern JavaScript library development (3:56:00)</p></li><li><p>Ken Kunz explained how finite state machines (and the svelte-fsm library) can make managing Svelte component states more... manageable. Examples from the talk are available on Ken's GitHub. (4:07:18)</p></li><li><p>Austin Crim connected learning to code on the web to learning how to play an instrument. By giving learners early wins and introducing the fundamentals through real-world apps, learning Svelte (and the fundamentals underneath) doesn't have to be a chore (4:21:50)</p></li><li><p>Jesse Skinner brought our legacy apps into the future by explaining how to use (and reuse) Svelte components within React (and even jQuery!) projects (4:32:30)</p></li><li><p>Jim Fisk and Stephanie Luz introduced Plenti and its theming tools to make building new Svelte sites much faster (4:59:00)</p></li><li><p>Evyatar Alush helped us all make (and maintain) better forms using a powerful validation library called Vest (5:08:55)</p></li><li><p>Dominik G. presented a fresh take on icon libraries - one that reduces the bundle size of applications and opens up the entire iconify library for use in any Svelte app (5:30:04)</p></li></ul><p>Thanks to Kevin and all the Svelte Society volunteers for pulling together such an amazing event! Excitingly, Kevin announced after the event that he will now be working full-time on Svelte Society!

      "body": "<p>Yesterday we just celebrated the 5th Vueniversary — today we are excited to announce the release of Vue 2.6 “Macross”!</p><p>In the past year, we spent a lot of time working on the new CLI and prototyping for 3.0. As a result, Vue core 2.x hasn’t received major updates in quite a while. It’s about time! This release combines a number of substantial improvements, internal changes and new features which are highlighted in this post. For full details, make sure to also check out the full release note on GitHub.</p><h1><strong>Slots: New Syntax, Performance Improvements &amp; Alignment with 3.0</strong></h1><p>Slots is an important mechanism that enables flexible component composition in Vue. During the prototyping for 3.0 we discovered a number of ways to improve it. Some of these can be introduced without breaking changes, which allows us to ship them in a 2.x minor release. For those that do require breaking changes, we are also trying to provide progressive alternatives in 2.x that would make future migrations easier.</p><h2><strong>New Syntax</strong></h2><p>The first step is the new syntax of scoped slots. We proposed, discussed and experimented with a number of different designs (1, 2, 3) and eventually landed on the new <code>v-slot</code> syntax outlined in this RFC. Here is a brief example using named slots:</p>",

      "title": "Plans for the Next Iteration of Vue.js",
      "body": "<p>Last week at Vue.js London I gave a brief sneak peek of what’s coming in the next major version of Vue. This post provides an in-depth overview of the plan.</p><h1><strong>Why a new major version?</strong></h1><p>Vue 2.0 was released exactly two years ago (how time flies!). During this period, the core has remained backwards compatible with five minor releases. We’ve accumulated a number of ideas that would bring improvements, but they were held off because they would result in breaking changes. At the same time, the JavaScript ecosystem and the language itself has been evolving rapidly. There are greatly improved tools that could enhance our workflow, and many new language features that could unlock simpler, more complete, and more efficient solutions to the problems Vue is trying to solve. What’s more exciting is that we are seeing ES2015 support becoming a baseline for all major evergreen browsers. Vue 3.0 aims to leverage these new language features to make Vue core smaller, faster, and more powerful.</p><p>Vue 3.0 is currently in prototyping phase, and we have already implemented a runtime close to feature-parity with 2.x. <strong>Many of the items listed below are either already implemented, or confirmed to be feasible. Ones that are not yet implemented or still in exploration phase are marked with a *.</strong></p><h1><strong>The Details</strong></h1><h2><strong>High-Level API Changes</strong></h2><blockquote><p><em>TL;DR: Everything except render function API and scoped-slots syntax will either remain the same or can be made 2.x compatible via a compatibility build.</em></p></blockquote><p>Since it’s a new major, there is going to be some breaking changes. However, we take backwards compatibility seriously, so we want to start communicating these changes as soon as possible. Here’s the currently planned public API changes:</p><ul><li><p>Template syntax will remain 99% the same. There may be small tweaks in scoped slots syntax, but other than that we have no plans to change anything else for templates.</p></li><li><p>̶3̶.̶0̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶s̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶c̶l̶a̶s̶s̶-̶b̶a̶s̶e̶d̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶o̶n̶e̶n̶t̶s̶ ̶n̶a̶t̶i̶v̶e̶l̶y̶ . <em>Update: the Class API draft has been dropped. We have published a new function-based API proposal that provides better logic composition, better TypeScript support, and compatible with 2.x API.</em></p></li><li><p>Mixins will still be supported.*</p></li><li><p>Top level APIs will likely receive an overhaul to avoid globally mutating the Vue runtime when installing plugins. Instead, plugins will be applied and scoped to a component tree. This will make it easier to test components that rely on specific plugins, and also make it possible to mount multiple Vue applications on the same page with different plugins, but using the same Vue runtime.* <em>(Update: related RFC)</em></p></li><li><p>Functional components can finally be plain functions —however, async components will now need to be explicitly created via a helper function. <em>(Update: related RFC)</em></p></li><li><p>The part that will receive the most changes is the Virtual DOM format used in render functions. We are currently collecting feedback from major library authors and will be sharing more details as we are more confident of the changes, but as long as you don’t heavily rely on hand-written (non-JSX) render functions in your app, upgrading should be a reasonably straightforward process.</p></li></ul>",
